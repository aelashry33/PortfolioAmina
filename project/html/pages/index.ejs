    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <img src="/images/unnamed.jpg" alt="Image of Amina"  class="amina"><br>
    <p>
        I am a driven and motivated incoming freshman at the University of Maryland College Park, studying computer science with a
        concentration in data science. <br><br> My ultimate career goal is to be able to inspire and motivate people to believe in the impact
        their perseverance, strength, and hard work can have on themselves and the world around them through the power of technology.
        I am hungry for not only for knowledge, but also for opportunities to become involved in the field in order to innovate, change,
        and provide effective solutions through my work. I am very excited to begin my computer science journey, and positive that I will enjoy
        every step of the way.
        <br><br>I enjoy running, traveling with my family, and writing poetry in my free time!
